Hosted here are:

Subdirectory bmachine: Broadcast Machine, an Internet TV publishing
package, integrating a Bittorrent tracker, an RSS server, and a
content management system into one easy-to-use Web application that
can be installed by dragging a folder into your FTP client -- no
database setup needed.

Subdirectory tv: The centerpiece of the Miro platform, Miro
Player is a desktop application that aims to make Internet TV an
enjoyable experience for even the least technically sophisticated
user. The Player can view channels created with Broadcast Machine as
well as a wide variety of other video sources on the Internet. It also
integrates with the remaining two components of the Miro
platform: Channel Guide for promoting channels and Video Bomb for easy
end-user republishing and social promotion of individual videos.

Subdirectory dtv-binary-kit: Prebuilt binary dependencies for building
Miro Player on Windows -- so developers can get up and running in
half an hour instead of a week. If used, it should be checked out
'alongside' the source to Miro Player. That is, 'tv' and
'dtv-binary-kit' should both be subdirectories of the same
directory. If you're reading this file, odds are good that you just
checked out the whole repository, and so this has already been taken
care of for you :)

Channel Guide and Video Bomb are tracked in other repositories.
