Forker's Notes
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This Fork is supposed to be for adding the ability to run Miro on the Haiku Operating System:
The website for it is found at: https://www.haiku-os.org

As of this message, I'm aware that Miro has been discontinued, though I have tested the latest version on a modern platform and
most of the features of it still work. I hope to after adding support for this new platform to even possibly modernize 
the rest of the code.

  promotion of individual videos.
