Contained in this directory is the debian directory that we use to build the
debian packages.  Here's how to use it:

1) install the debhelper and cdbs packages:
sudo apt-get install debhelper cdbs

2) Get the source tarball, untar it into "democracyplayer-VERSION" (for
example democracyplayer-0.9.2.2)

3) Add a new entry to debian/changelog, use the previous entries as your
template.

Make sure you change the version number.  The version number is the version
number from above + "1ubuntupcf".  If you make 2 ubuntu packages for the same
release, name the second one "2ubuntupcf".

Make sure your date string is in RFC-2822 format.  Use "date -R".

4) copy the debian directory into the directory you just untarred.

5) cd to the same directory and run:

dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc -rfakeroot

6) If everything goes well, you should have your .debs.  If something goes
wrong, then you'll need to fix other files in the debian directory, probably
debian/control.  That's beyond the scope of this README though.

7) Once your build works, check in the updated debian directory to svn.
