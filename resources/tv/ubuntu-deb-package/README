Contained in this directory is the debian/ directory that we use to build the
Debian packages.  Here's how to use it:

1) Install the debhelper and cdbs packages:
   $ sudo apt-get install debhelper cdbs

2) Get the source tarball, untar it into "democracyplayer-VERSION" (for
   example democracyplayer-0.9.2.2)

3) Add a new entry to debian/changelog, use the previous entries as your
   template.
   Make sure you change the version number.  The version number is the version
   number from above + "-1ubuntupcf".  If you make 2 Ubuntu packages for the
   same release, name the second one "-2ubuntupcf".
   Example: 0.9.2.2-1ubuntupcf
   
   Make sure your date string is in RFC-2822 format.  Use "date -R".

4) Copy the debian/ directory into the directory you just untarred.

5) cd to the same directory and run:
   $ dpkg-buildpackage -us -uc -rfakeroot

6) If everything goes well, you should have your .debs.  If something goes
   wrong, then you'll need to fix other files in the debian/ directory,
   probably debian/control.  That's beyond the scope of this README though.

7) Now test the packages manually and via the tools lintian/linda:
   - $ apt-get install lintian linda
     $ lintian -i -I *.changes
     $ linda -i *.changes
     (Not all warnings are critical, though)
   - $ sudo dpkg -i democracy*deb
     $ democracyplayer

8) Once the build and the package itself works, clean up the debian/ directory:
   $ fakeroot debian/rules clean
   Then check in the updated debian/ directory to svn.
