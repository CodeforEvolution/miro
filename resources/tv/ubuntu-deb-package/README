Contained in this directory is the debian/ directory that we use to build the
Debian packages.  Here's how to use it:

0) Run apt-get upgrade, we should only be building for systems with the latest
   updates.

1) Install the debhelper and cdbs packages:
   $ sudo apt-get install debhelper cdbs

2) Add a new entry to debian/changelog, use the previous entries as your
   template.
   Make sure you change the version number.  The version number is the version
   number from above + "-1ubuntupcf".  If you make 2 Ubuntu packages for the
   same release, name the second one "-2ubuntupcf".
   Example: 0.9.2.2-1ubuntupcf
   
   Make sure your date string is in RFC-2822 format.  Use "date -R".

2a) If you're building it on ubuntu edgy or dapper, use the debian-edgy
    directory instead.

3) Run build.py [version number] [distro name] [debian directory]

   For example: build.py 0.9.5 feisty debian/

4) If everything goes well, you should have your .debs in a directory named
   after your distro, along with Packages.gz.  This directory can be used to
   create an APT repository if you want.

   If something went wrong, then you'll need to fix other files in the debian/
   directory, probably debian/control.  That's beyond the scope of this README
   though.

5) Now test the packages manually and via the tools lintian/linda:
   - $ apt-get install lintian linda
     $ lintian -i -I *.changes
     $ linda -i *.changes
     (Not all warnings are critical, though)
   - $ sudo dpkg -i democracy*deb
     $ democracyplayer

6) Once the build and the package itself works, clean up the debian/ directory:
   $ fakeroot debian/rules clean
   Then check in the updated debian/ directory to svn.
