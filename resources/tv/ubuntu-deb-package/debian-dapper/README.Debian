democracyplayer for Debian
--------------------------

 * The default Democracy Player movies directory in Debian
   is ~/.democracy/Movies instead of ~/Movies/Democracy.

 * Also, the non-video directory in Debian is ~/.democracy/Nonvideo
   instead of ~/Desktop.

 * The autoupdate feature, which checks for new versions of Democracy Player,
   has been disabled in the Debian package.
