miro for Debian
--------------------------

 * The default Miro movies directory in Debian
   is ~/.miro/Movies instead of ~/Movies/Miro.

 * Also, the non-video directory in Debian is ~/.miro/Nonvideo
   instead of ~/Desktop.

 * The autoupdate feature, which checks for new versions of Miro Player,
   has been disabled in the Debian package.
