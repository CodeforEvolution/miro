These buildscripts are for automatically building, packaging, and uploading new 
versions of democracy to the Participatory Culture Foundation's server for release. 
Here's how they work:

To run a script, use the following command:

./scriptname username version

Where:
-username is your account on pcf2 (used to scp files)
-version is the version number of Democracy you wish to build (must have a tag in subversion)
-You must run the script with sudo in Fedora Core

When the script is finished, you should find a folder in your home directory 
with all of the packages. 

For example, say you want to build Democracy 0.8.5 on Fedora Core 5:
sudo ./fc5 oppy 0.8.5

When the script is done, all of the files should be in /home/oppy/0.8.5/
