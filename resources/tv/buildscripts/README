These buildscripts are for automatically building, packaging, and uploading new 
versions of democracy to the Participatory Culture Foundation's server for release. 
Here's how they work:

To run a script, use the following command:

For Mac OSX
===========

To make a nightly build and place it on your desktop::

   ./osx
 
To make a build and upload it to nightlies::

   ./osx <username> <tag>

Where:

* <username> is your login name on pcf2.osuosl.org (you'll be prompted for your password later).
* <tag> is the version of DP you wish to build.
   If you don't specify a tag, the build will be made from the latest trunk revision.


For everything else
===================

To make a build::

   ./scriptname <username> <tag>

Where:

* <username> is your account on pcf2 (used to scp files)
* <tag> is the version number of Democracy you wish to build (must have a tag in subversion)

.. Note::

   You must run the script with sudo in Fedora Core

When the script is finished, you should find a folder in your home directory 
with all of the packages. 

For example, say you want to build Democracy 0.8.5 on Fedora Core 5::

   sudo ./fc5 oppy 0.8.5

When the script is done, all of the files should be in ``/home/oppy/0.8.5/``.
