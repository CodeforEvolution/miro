To run the application, run launch.py in the appropriate platform
subdirectory (platform/$YOUR_PLATFORM/launch.py, where $YOUR_PLATFORM
is 'windows', 'linux', or 'osx'.) This sets the module search path
correctly and runs main() in the app module.

Put platform-specific code in 'platform/$PLATFORM'; this is searched
first when importing modules. Put platform-independent code in
'portable'. If you have code that isn't used on all platforms, but is
the same on two platforms -- for example, wxPython widgets -- put it
in (a subdirectory of?) 'platform/shared'. Then, supposing your module
is myModule.py, create a 'platform/$PLATFORM/myModule.py' for each
platform that uses the module that contains a line like "from
shared.myModule import *". Then users of your code can simply "import
myModule" and it will be transparent to them.

Put resource files that should be distributed with the application in
'resources.' They can be accessed with resource.path().
