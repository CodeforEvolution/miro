These are helper scripts that are distribution/version specific to help
you install the dependencies you need to run Miro from the source tarball
or the git repository.

These scripts are maintained by contributors--people like you!

You're a better expert on how to install requirements on the 
distribution/version that you use!  If you see errors in these scripts or 
things that could be improved, let us know!  Patches are more than welcome.

You can find us here:

IRC:          #miro-hackers on freenode.net
mailing list: http://mailman.pculture.org/listinfo/develop

Or you can email me directly at will.guaraldi at pculture.net.
