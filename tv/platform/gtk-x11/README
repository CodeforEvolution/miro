This is the GTK/X11 port of Democracy TV.

If you want to test it, execute ./run.sh. If you have the required
dependencies it should build everything and run it.

See https://develop.participatoryculture.org/projects/dtv/wiki/GTKX11BuildDocs
(This is considered the authoritative source.)

There are several major installation theories to respect here in the Linux
world: a) Debian b) Fedora (Red Hat). We will need to get someone from the
Gentoo or Ubuntu spheres to contribute here. Other GTK/X11 ports should 
follow one of these or bring their own conventions.

In addition to the major distribution theoretics, there is also the issue of
the desktop, for which there seems to be two major choices: GNOME and KDE.
This is the GTK/X11 port of Democracy TV, so the focus here is exclusively
on GNOME.

Democracy TV requires Python 2.4; Pyrex is used for Python to C and
C++ code.
