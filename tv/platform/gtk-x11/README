This is a preliminary GTK/X11 port of DTV.

Run test.sh to start the app.

Currently, there's no way to build a distributable binary.

You'll need Pyrex, PyObjC and Boost to compile DTV. We use these for
linking to C, Objective C, and C++ code.

You'll also need python-gtk2, python-gnome2-extras, mozilla-dev, and
whatever packages those depend on for the GTK port.

I'm using Debian unstable with a few packages from experimental. I
tried to avoid distribution specific paths, but I may have left some
in there.
