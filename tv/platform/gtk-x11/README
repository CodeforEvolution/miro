This is a preliminary GTK/X11 port of DTV.

Run test.sh to start the app.

Currently, there's no way to build a distributable binary.

DTV requires Python 2.4.  You'll need python-pyrex and
libboost-python-dev to compile DTV. We use these for linking to C and
C++ code.  For the GTK port you'll also need python-gtk2-dev,
python-gnome2-extras-dev, mozilla-dev, and whatever packages those
depend on.

I'm using Debian unstable with a few packages from experimental. I
tried to avoid distribution specific paths, but I may have left some
in there.
