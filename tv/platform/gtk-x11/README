Summary
=======

This is the GTK/X11 port of Miro.

If you want to test it, execute ``./run.sh``. If you have the required
dependencies it should build Miro and run it.

See https://develop.participatoryculture.org/projects/dtv/wiki/GTKX11BuildDocs
for more information on building and executing the GTK-X11 platform code.
The information at this url is considered the authoritative source.



Build and run instructions
==========================

Instructions and build requirements are documented at
https://develop.participatoryculture.org/trac/democracy/wiki/GTKX11BuildDocs


Unittest instructions
=====================

Once you get ``./run.sh`` working, you can run the unittests on GTK-X11 
platform.  Do the following::

   ./run.sh --unittest


This will go through all the unittests on the GTK-X11 platform and spit out 
any errors to stdout and stderr.
