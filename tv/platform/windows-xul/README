Summary
=======

This is the Gtk-Windows port of Miro.

Instructions and build requirements are documented at
https://develop.participatoryculture.org/trac/democracy/wiki/WindowsBuildDocs


Build and run
=============

To compile and run Miro in the current directory, do::

   ./run.sh

This does the following two steps:

1. ``python setup.py bdist_miro``
2. ``dist\Miro.exe``

If you have the required dependencies it should build Miro and run it.

See https://develop.participatoryculture.org/projects/dtv/wiki/WindowsBuildDocs
for more information on building and executing the Gtk-Windows platform code.
The information at this url is considered the authoritative source.


To build an installer
=====================

To build an installer, do::

    python setup.py bdist_nsis   

That'll build Miro, then wrap it in a NullSoft installer.  The resulting files
will be something like::

    dist\Miro-2.0-svn-twostage.exe
    dist\Miro-2.0-svn.exe

The second one is the "full" installer.
