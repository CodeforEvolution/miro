Text=Do You Use Firefox?  Help Out!\r\n\r\nIf you use Firefox, you can help support the non-profit that makes Miro by installing this simple Firefox extension.  The extension, called 'I Heart Miro' gives our organization a small referral payment on any purchase you make on Amazon.com.  It doesn't cost you anything, it doesn't track what you buy, and you can remove it easily at any time.\r\n\r\nWould you like to install I Heart Miro?
