Here's how the locale directories work on windows.

* The source of the strings is the en-US/*.dtd.template files.  The strings
from here get sent out to be translated.  If you need to add a new string, add
it to one of these files.  If you create a new window, create a new
.dtd.template file.

* Once strings are translated, we download the new translations and run
tv/resources/locale/build-catalogs.py.  This populates all the other
language directories with the .dtd.template files.

* In setup.py we make .dtd files from the .dtd.template files by doing a
couple simple substitutions.  For example "$longAppName" -> "Miro".

* When we startup Miro we pick the correct language directory to use
as the source of our .dtd files.  Translated strings are stored as XUL
entities for example "&main.title;".
