This directory contains headers for XPCOM interfaces that are not
frozen by mozilla.org, but which we absolutely can't do without. Each
should be documented here and an appropriate excuse made.

nsIBaseWindow:
 It's absolutely required for embedding and must be copied in from the main
 build:

 More recently (7/3/05), according to this, it's coming to the SDK in 1.8:

nsIWebNavigation:
 Can't find any other way to initiate a load of a URL into a new WebBrowser
 (or hell, any other way to manipulate its content.) It's used for this
 purpose in the embedding samples. Another person who resorted to nabbing
 the unfrozen interface:
