To build DTV for distribution, run build.sh in this directory. The result
is DTV.app, which is self-contained and should be safe to distribute.

To run the application quickly, without generating a distribution-safe
package, run ./test.sh. DTV.app, if it exists, is in the process
overwritten with a non-distribution-safe bundle tree that contains
symlinks that point outside the bundle.

You'll need Pyrex, PyObjC and Boost to compile DTV. We use these for
linking to C, Objective C, and C++ code. And you'll need Python 2.4 or
later.

At least as of 1.3.7, the prebuilt PyObjC binaries do not have proper
Quicktime support, so you'll have to build from source. Download and untar:
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/pyobjc/pyobjc-1.3.7.tar.gz

Then, per the installation documentation included in the package,
build and install by running:
python setup.py bdist_mpkg --open

You can download Pyrex here:
http://www.cosc.canterbury.ac.nz/~greg/python/Pyrex/
http://www.cosc.canterbury.ac.nz/~greg/python/Pyrex/Pyrex-0.9.3.tar.gz

There's a bug in Pyrex's distutils support in version 0.9.3, so you'll
have to change line 35 in build_ext.py, which is typically located at:
    /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.4/lib/python2.4/
    site-packages/Pyrex/Distutils
from:
    def swig_sources (self,sources):
to:
    def swig_sources (self, sources, extension=None):

before you can start building. I already sent an email to Greg about
it, so hopefully, it'll get fixed in the next release.

Finally, you'll need the Boost C++ library. The easiest option is to
install it using Darwinports or Fink. Otherwise, you'll have to build
it from source, as follows:

---
You can download Boost here:
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=7586&package_id=8041
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/boost/boost_1_33_0.tar.gz?download

You'll need Boost.Jam to build Boost. You can get it here:
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=7586&package_id=72941
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/boost/boost-jam-3.1.11-1-macosxppc.tgz?download

The instructions for installing Boost are here:
http://www.boost.org/more/getting_started.html

I used Boost 1.33.0 and Boost.Jam 3.1.11-1, installed bjam to
/usr/local/bin, and used the following command to build and install
Boost. You may need to do things slightly differently in order to get
it to work for you. 

PYTHON_VERSION=2.4 bjam -sTOOLS=darwin --with-python-root=/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.4 --with-pydebug install

It appears that the build script doesn't build the unit tests
correctly on OS X, and it reports that 10 target failed to build. This
doesn't seem to be an issue.
