To build DTV for distribution, run build.sh in this directory. The result
is DTV.app, which is self-contained and should be safe to distribute.

To run the application quickly, without generating a distribution-safe
package, run ./test.sh. DTV.app, if it exists, is in the process
overwritten with a non-distribution-safe bundle tree that contains
symlinks that point outside the bundle.

You'll need Pyrex, PyObjC and Boost to compile DTV. We use these for
linking to C, Objective C, and C++ code.

You can download PyObjC here.
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/pyobjc/pyobjc-1.2-python2.3-macosx10.3.dmg?download

You can download Pyrex here:

http://www.cosc.canterbury.ac.nz/~greg/python/Pyrex/Pyrex-0.9.3.tar.gz

There's a bug in Pyrex distutils version 0.9.3, so you'll have to
change line 35 in build_ext.py from

    def swig_sources (self,sources):
to 
    def swig_sources (self, sources, extension):

before you can start building. I already sent an email to Greg about
it, so hopefully, it'll get fixed in the next release.

You can download Boost here:
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=7586&package_id=8041
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/boost/boost_1_33_0.tar.gz?download

You'll need Boost.Jam to build Boost. You can get it here:
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=7586&package_id=72941
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/boost/boost-jam-3.1.11-1-macosxppc.tgz?download

The instructions for installing Boost are here:
http://www.boost.org/more/getting_started.html

I used Boost 1.33.0 and Boost.Jam 3.1.11-1, installed bjam to
/usr/local/bin, and used the following command to build and install
Boost. You may need to do things slightly differently in order to get
it to work for you. 

PYTHON_VERSION=2.4 bjam -sTOOLS=darwin --with-python-root=/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.4 --with-pydebug install

It appears that the build script doesn't build the unit tests
correctly on OS X, and it reports that 10 target failed to build. This
doesn't seem to be an issue.
