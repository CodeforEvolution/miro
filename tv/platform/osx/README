On the development machine, you will need to have installed PyObjC,
available here:
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/pyobjc/pyobjc-1.2-python2.3-macosx10.3.dmg?download

To build for distribution, run build.sh in this directory. The result
is DTV.app, which is self-contained and should be safe to distribute.

To run the application quickly, without generating a distribution-safe
package, run ./test.sh. DTV.app, if it exists, is in the process
overwritten with a non-distribution-safe bundle tree that contains
symlinks that point outside the bundle.
