On the development machine, you will need to have installed PyObjC,
available here:
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/pyobjc/pyobjc-1.2-python2.3-macosx10.3.dmg?download

You'll also need Pyrex, which is available here:
http://www.cosc.canterbury.ac.nz/~greg/python/Pyrex/
http://www.cosc.canterbury.ac.nz/~greg/python/Pyrex/Pyrex-0.9.3.tar.gz

There's a bug in Pyrex distutils version 0.9.3, so you'll have to
change line 35 in build_ext.py from

    def swig_sources (self,sources):
to 
    def swig_sources (self, sources, extension):

before you can start building. I already sent an email to Greg about
it, so hopefully, it'll get fixed in the next release.

To build for distribution, run build.sh in this directory. The result
is DTV.app, which is self-contained and should be safe to distribute.

To run the application quickly, without generating a distribution-safe
package, run ./test.sh. DTV.app, if it exists, is in the process
overwritten with a non-distribution-safe bundle tree that contains
symlinks that point outside the bundle.
