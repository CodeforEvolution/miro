Summary
=======

This is the OSX port of Miro.

Instructions and build requirements are documented at
https://develop.participatoryculture.org/trac/democracy/wiki/OSXBuildDocs


Setup build environment
=======================

Run ``setup_sandbox.sh`` if you're using Mac OSX 10.4.

Run ``setup_sandbox_10.5.sh`` if you're using Mac OSX 10.5.


Build and run
=============

To compile and run Miro in the current directory, do::

   ./run.sh

Miro.app, if it exists, is in the process overwritten with a 
non-distribution-safe bundle tree that contains symlinks that point outside 
the bundle.

See https://develop.participatoryculture.org/projects/dtv/wiki/OSXBuildDocs
for more information on building and executing the OSX platform code.
The information at this url is considered the authoritative source.

To build a ``.app`` file, do::

   ./build.sh

The result is ``Miro.app``, which is self-contained and should be safe to 
distribute.

To build a ``.dmg`` file, do::

   ./build.sh --make-dmg
