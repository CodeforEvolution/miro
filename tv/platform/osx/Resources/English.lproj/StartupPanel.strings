Setup is complete -- now you can find some channels and start watching.

Don't Wait: Democracy is different than watching webpage videos -- publishers can offer big, high quality videos. So don't sit around waiting for videos: start some downloads and check back later. 

Leave it On: Democracy Player regularly checks channels for new videos and downloads in the background. Leaving it running means you'll have new videos when you're ready to watch.

Don't Worry About Disk Space: Like a TiVo, Democracy Player features an 'expiration' system that helps clean out older videos to make room for new videos. You can always keep a video permanently by clicking 'save' and you can set a channel's settings to save videos automatically.

Go Big: The button to the right of the play button shows videos fullscreen.

Find Videos: The Democracy Channel Guide has hundreds of internet TV channels, all of them are free. Just click 'ADD' to watch a channel.
