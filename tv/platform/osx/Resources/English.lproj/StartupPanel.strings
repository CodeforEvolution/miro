Setup is complete -- now you can find some channels and start watching.

Don't Wait: Miro is different than watching webpage videos -- publishers can offer big, high quality videos. So don't sit around waiting for videos: start some downloads and check back later. 

Leave it On: Miro regularly checks channels for new videos and downloads in the background. Leaving it running means you'll have new videos when you're ready to watch.

Don't Worry About Disk Space: Like a TiVo, Miro features an 'expiration' system that helps clean out older videos to make room for new videos. You can always keep a video permanently by clicking 'save' and you can set a channel's settings to save videos automatically.

Go Big: The button to the right of the play button shows videos fullscreen.

Find Videos: The Miro Guide has hundreds of internet TV channels, all of them are free. Just click 'ADD' to watch a channel.
