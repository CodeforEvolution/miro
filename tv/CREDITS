Special thanks

Holmes Wilson, Tiffiniy Cheng, and Nick Reville of the Participatory
Culture Foundation in Worcester, who had the idea and made it
happen. They find us funding, magic up user interface templates,
wrangle the website and the press, manage companion projects like
Broadcast Machine, make our hosting and infrastructure arrangements,
test release builds, set up partnerships with other organizations that
want to host feeds, and help us in other ways too numerous to mention,
all so we can focus on writing open-source software.

Buzz at oska dot com, for figuring out how to build Windows DTV with
the free Microsoft compiler release.
