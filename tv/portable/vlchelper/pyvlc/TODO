* Handle all FIXME's from the code:
  * Create a real RGBPicture and StreamInformation object
  * Make vlc.Object variables attributes of the object (cf vlcdebug.py)

* Enhance the vlc.Object binding

* Move mediacontrol-core.c to vlc/src and mediacontrol-core.h to vlc/include,
  so that we can use it for both the python binding module and the
  CORBA plugin.

* [API change] Make the playlist a class (inheriting from list) which
could be manipulated.
