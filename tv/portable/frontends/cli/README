The cli frontend is a toy frontend.  It's main purpose is to show how to
create an alternate frontend.  It might be a little bit useful if you want to
manipulate miro without X11, however it's functionality is quite limited.

Tab completion is fairly good, try it out.

It's possible to answer dialog boxes.  But it's really a complete hack to do
it with a CLI.

Here are the supported commands:

feeds -- list all feeds
playlists -- list all playlists

feed <name> -- select a feed
playlist <name> -- select a playlist
downloads -- select downloading items

items -- list the items in the feed/playlist/downloads
rm <item name> -- delete an item
download <item name> -- download an item
stop <item name> -- stop a download
pause <item name> -- pause a download

rmfeed <name> -- delete a feed
