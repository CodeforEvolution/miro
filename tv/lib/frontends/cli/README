Summary
=======

The cli frontend is a toy frontend.  It's main purpose is to show how to
create an alternate frontend.  It might be a little bit useful if you want to
manipulate miro without X11, however it's functionality is quite limited.

Tab completion is fairly good, try it out.

It's possible to answer dialog boxes.  But it's really a complete hack to do
it with a CLI.
