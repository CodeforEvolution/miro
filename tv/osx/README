Summary
=======

This is the OSX port of Miro.

Instructions and build requirements are documented at
https://develop.participatoryculture.org/trac/democracy/wiki/OSXBuildDocs


Setup build environment
=======================

Run ``setup_binary_kit.sh`` then ``setup_sandbox.sh``.

This works for OSX 10.5 and 10.6.

Building and running Miro on Mac OS X 10.4 or earlier is not supported.


Build and run
=============

To compile and run Miro in the current directory, do::

   ./run.sh

Miro.app, if it exists, is in the process overwritten with a 
non-distribution-safe bundle tree that contains symlinks that point outside 
the bundle.

See https://develop.participatoryculture.org/projects/dtv/wiki/OSXBuildDocs
for more information on building and executing the OSX platform code.
The information at this url is considered the authoritative source.

To build a ``.app`` file, do::

   ./build.sh

The result is ``Miro.app``, which is self-contained and should be safe to 
distribute.

To build a ``.dmg`` file, do::

   ./build.sh --make-dmg


Running tests
=============

To run unittests on OSX, do::

   ./run.sh unittest

To run unittests verbosely, do::

   ./run.sh unittest -v
