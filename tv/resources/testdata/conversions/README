These files are output from ffmpeg/ffmpeg2theora runs from command line
sequences used by Miro.

To build new ones::

    commandline > output.txt 2>&1

where commandline is the line from Miro.

This is easily done on Linux and OSX and probably more difficult on Windows.

The output is verbatim except for the sake of reducing space used and time it
takes to run the tests, I sometimes remove progress lines.
