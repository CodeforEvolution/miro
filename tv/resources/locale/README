Summary
=======

Export strings to Launchpad
---------------------------

Run ``export-strings.sh`` to build the ``messages.pot`` file.  Then go to
the Launchpad site and upload the ``messages.pot`` file.

Commit everything.


Import translations from Launchpad
----------------------------------

Go to the Launchpad site and export all ``.po`` files.

They'll send you an email with the url to download the ``.tar.gz`` file
from.

Move the file into this directory (``tv/resources/locale/``), extract all the files,
move the files in ``democracyplayer/`` into this directory, remove the ``democracyplayer/``
directory and run ``import-translations.py``.

Commit everything.
