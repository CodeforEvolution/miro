Requirements
============

You must build the documentation on a valid gtk-x11 platform.  This
means that platform-specific documentation is of gtk-x11.

You must have the Sphinx documentation tools installed and running
``./run.sh`` from ``platform/gtk-x11/`` should work as well.


Building the docs
=================

    make html


If documentation building is successful, then it will be in the ./_build/html/
directory.

To clean out the directory::

    make clean
