==================

Extensions are currently considered a beta feature.  The API is pretty
nascent.  It's very likely you will want to do things that aren't in
the API.

We need your help and input to grow the API.  If no one helps, then it 
will stay the way it is.

The following non-comprehensive list of things are probably possible 
with the existing infrastructure:

* extensions that add additional logging
* extensions that expose Miro data through protocols (DBUS, MPRIS, ...)
* a web-based control interface
* extensions that schedule upload/download speeds for torrents
* extensions that provide additional device support
* extensions that provide additional search engine support

I suspect the following are either very difficult or impossible with the
current infrastructure:

* extensions that modify or extend the user interface
* extensions that schedule the downloader
* extensions that schedule download speeds for HTTP downloads
