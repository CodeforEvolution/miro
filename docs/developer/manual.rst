About this API
==============

This is the documentation for the Extensions API for Miro.

Currently, the API is pretty bare.  Over time, the API will grow as
people write extensions and functionality is required.  It's a start 
and it's something we're working on where "we" includes you, too.

For coding conventions, standards, et al--see the developer wiki at:

* http://develop.participatoryculture.org/index.php/MiroStart

For details on extensions, see:

* http://develop.participatoryculture.org/index.php/ExtensionSystem
* http://develop.participatoryculture.org/index.php/ExtensionAPI


How to help
===========

This API is not and never will be complete.  It will grow alongside Miro.

Documentation for modules, classes, functions and methods is done in
docstrings in the source code.

Your work will help flesh out this API.  If you're writing an extension
or are otherwise interested in Miro extensions, hop on IRC on the
``#miro-hackers`` channel on Freenode and join the conversation.
