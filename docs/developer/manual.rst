About this API
==============

This is the API for the Miro code base.  A quick check will show it's
woefully incomplete, but it's a start and it's something we're working
on.

For coding conventions, standards, et al--see the developer wiki at:

http://develop.participatoryculture.org/index.php/MiroStart

The API is versioned alongside Miro.


How to help
===========

This API is not and never will be complete.  It will grow alongside Miro.

Documentation for modules, classes, functions and methods is done in
docstrings in the source code.

I'm very interested in getting help to continue documenting things and
fixing existing documentation.  If you'd like to help, hop on IRC on
the ``#miro-hackers`` channel on Freenode.
