About this manual
=================

This manual is developer-focused and will codify out-of-line
documentation, standard practices, how-to documents and other things
for the Miro project.

It is versioned alongside Miro--2.5 of this document corresponds to
Miro 2.5.


How to help
===========

This document is not and never will be complete.  It will grow
alongside Miro.

Documentation for modules, classes, functions and methods is done in
docstrings in the source code.

Documentation for how-tos, architecture, standard practices and that
sort of thing is in the documentation source.

I'm very interested in getting help to continue documenting things and
fixing existing documentation.  If you'd like to help, hop on IRC on
the ``#miro-hackers`` channel on Freenode.
