This manual is the architectural and code documentation for Miro.  It's
intended for developers of Miro and anyone else who might be using
Miro code for their projects.

It is not a user guide.

Documentation
=============

Developer-focused documentation is in the Trac wiki at
https://develop.participatoryculture.org/ .  Here you'll find build
documentation for the three Miro platforms, architecture
documentation, testing and QA documentation, information on
translating and packaging Miro, code style, and a bunch of pages that
discuss decisions made during Miro development over the eons.  Some of
this documentation will be absorbed into this manual.

There's documentation in the developer blogs which are syndicated on
http://planet.getmiro.com/ .

User documentation is primarily on the Get Miro site:
