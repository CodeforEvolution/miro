idltools:
Hand-build from Mozilla head, mid-October 2005.

idlinclude: Copied from 'idl' directory of
'gecko-sdk-i586-pc-msvc-1.7.8' -- not from 'dist/idl' in a Mozilla
build, because I wanted to err on the side of taking only frozen
interfaces.

pyxpcom: Hand-build from the Xulrunner 1.8.0.1 source release:
ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/xulrunner/releases/1.8.0.1/source/xulrunner-1.8.0.1-source.tar.bz2
.. using config file mozconfig.pyxpcom, and patched with my
pyxpcom-embedding.patch, both of which are provided in this
directory. The patch has been submitted to Mozilla; see their Bugzilla
#325497. (Release build.)

boost:
The Boost C++ library, version 1.33, hand-built with Python support
usin MSVC 7.1.  To save space, only the headers and the Boost-Python
bits are here -- this is all DTV needs.

vc71redist:
Microsoft Visual C 7.1 redistributable runtime DLLs, from
  c:\Program File\Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2003\SDK\v1.1\Bin
