This directory contains headers for XPCOM interfaces that are not
frozen by mozilla.org, but which we absolutely can't do without. Each
should be documented here and an appropriate excuse made.

nsIBaseWindow:
 It's absolutely required for embedding and must be copied in from the main
 build:
   http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.mozilla.devel.embedding/2164
 More recently (7/3/05), according to this, it's coming to the SDK in 1.8:
   http://www.mail-archive.org/mozilla-embedding@mozilla.org/msg05648.html

nsIWebNavigation:
 Can't find any other way to initiate a load of a URL into a new WebBrowser
 (or hell, any other way to manipulate its content.) It's used for this
 purpose in the embedding samples. Another person who resorted to nabbing
 the unfrozen interface:
   http://www2.all-usenet-archive.comp/File.asp?service=471
 (search for nsIWebNavigation)

nsIDOMNSRange:
 This has createContextualFragment, the Mozilla extension to the DOM Range
 object that is the Mozilla equivalent of IE's innerHTML. We need it to
 parse strings into new DOM nodes. It is not marked as frozen and isn't in
 the GRE SDK distribution. Couldn't find Web references to this situation.

nsIDOMElementCSSInlineStyle:
 This is used to geth the nsIDOMCSSStyleDeclaration of a node. I have
 no idea why this interface isn't frozen. It contains a single method,
 GetStyle, and is specified by the DOM Level 2 standard.
